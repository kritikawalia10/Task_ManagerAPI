# 📌 Task Manager Backend API

The **Task Manager Backend API** is a secure and scalable RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It allows registered users to manage their personal tasks by providing full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality, along with secure **JWT-based authentication**, **input validation**, and **protected routes**.

This project is structured following the **MVC pattern** and is designed to be production-ready, fully documented using **Swagger**, and easily testable via **Postman**. It is a practical backend application aimed at learning and implementing real-world backend concepts including authentication, error handling, deployment, and more.
